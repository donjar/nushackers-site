<h3>What is Hacking?</h3>

<p>The simplest way to define hacking is: 'playful cleverness'. We usually take it to mean the act of creating interesting software, but 'playful cleverness' may be applied to all sorts of things: life, music, hardware, food. <a href="/hackerdefined/">More on this →</a></p>

We have since changed our name to reflect the shifting nature of our organization: we now spend more time promoting hacking, programming-for-fun, and free/open-source-software use in the NUS community. <a href="/name-change/">More on the name change →</a></p>
